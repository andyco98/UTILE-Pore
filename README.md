# UTILE-Pore
We present  an automated workflow using deep learning for the analysis of porous-like structures from tomographs related to PEM technologies by: 1. preparing annotated dataset and training models in order to conduct semantic seg- mentation of pores and 2. automating the extraction of pore properties for further distribution analysis.
